# Dirty_Py_Turing_Machine
Python Turing Machine developped in 48 hours for a school project !

# WTF is this ?

A Turing Machine working with n_bands, translating bands between symbols and binary.

I've got a school project where we've got to implement functions on an existing Ocaml turing machine motor... But I was getting trolled so hard by Ocaml types, that instead of doing nothing, I reimplemented a Turing machine motor in Python and implement functions on it.

Original Project : http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~perin/enseignement/L3/mcal/projet/

# How does it works ?

"python3 main.py"

Everything is hardcoded in the main ^^

# It's full of bug :'(

=> The Transition parser is taking Ocaml implementation of transitions, and is not working for every type of transition.

=> The Binary band isn't working properly

=> Lots of extreme cases are not well handed

=> But, it's working for XOR :D

# Why are you posting this ? 

For eternity... But i don't know if it's worth the pain of debugging / optimizing it
